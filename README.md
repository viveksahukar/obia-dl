Integration of deep learning in object based image analysis
Course Project for CSE598: Machine Learning for Remote Sensing

This repository uses binary image segmentation datasets from GeoBench and provides code for replicating the results presented in the final project report. 

Each of the dataset has corresponding 3 files that contains the code to load and save the images, preprocess data, train the model, and run the evaluation on the test data.
